SABBATH or THE LORD’S DAY: Sorting through the Muddle

3.5.2021



In considering rhythms of life, we have been exploring Sabbath practices and the need for rest in our 24/7 culture. While the 4th commandment says the 7th day is for rest, many Christians worship on Sunday, the first day of the week, and may or may not rest on that day or dedicate any other day to rest.  


Opinions differ on Saturday/Sunday Sabbath as well as what constitutes rest and how the day is to be spent; much depends on how the 4th commandment is interpreted and applied to Christ- followers and this in turn, depends on how scripture is reasoned. In this little exploratory paper, we want to survey a few highlights from history to show how perspectives/practices evolved from the time of the early church to now, and then outline the 4 most common views today.

OT Sabbath Commands

4th Commandment, Exodus 20: 8-11 —“Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. 9 Six days you shall labor, and do all your work, 10 but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God. On it you shall not do any work, you, or your son, or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who is within your gates. 11 For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.



Deuteronomy 5:15 — Remember that you were once slaves in Egypt, but the Lord your God brought you out with his strong hand and powerful arm. That is why the Lord your God has commanded you to rest on the Sabbath day.



1st Century: The Jewish Sabbath  

For the most part, the Jews saw the Torah in a positive light, as a gift from Yahweh; Sabbath was viewed as a special day of rest and for delighting in him.  (See Abraham Heschel, Sabbath. . .a lovely view of Sabbath from a Jewish perspective)

The challenge was in defining what the 4th Commandment meant by work, so by Jesus’s day, the Rabbis had complied a long list of specific activities that were and were not allowed, some of which became quite legalistic

As Jesus taught, he came to “fulfill the law” not abolish it 


Until his death, he kept Sabbath and rest of the Mosaic law 

Jesus reformed Jewish Sabbath-keeping by challenging the “man-made traditions” that were burdensome and obscured Sabbath’s true purpose to rest and enjoy Yahweh and one another.

One of the major reasons tension rose between Jesus and the Pharisees is that he performed healing/caring acts on the Sabbath, which they interpreted as “work”

Jesus made it clear that “Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath, and that it was not only permissible, but in keeping of the intent of the day to do good for others on Sabbath

1st Century: Jewish Sabbath and the Christian Lord’s Day Side-by-Side

In the first century after the resurrection, the Jews/Gentile God-fearers who followed Jesus often continued to go to synagogue on Sabbath, the 7th day of the week, and then attend Christian worship on the 1st Day of the week, which the apostles also referred to as the Lord’s Day.  

NOTE: the Jews counted their days from sundown to sundown. Their Sabbath started on sundown Friday and ended on sundown Saturday.  So, what we now call Saturday evening was the beginning of 1st Day of the Jewish week (their days were numbered 1-6; the 7th day was called Sabbath). 

Eventually, the Roman name of Sun Day, named after the Sun God they worshipped, became the common name for the Jewish 1st Day, which Christians also referred to as The Lord’s Day.  (You can hear all three names in ancient literature)

Theologically, Christians met on the 1st Day for two main reasons:

This is when the Lord was resurrected and other important post-resurrection events occurred (ex: he appeared to the women at the tomb as well as other disciples)

It was the first day of the New Creation (2 Cor. 5:17), which believers also referred to as the “Eighth Day.” 

As some reasoned, the 7th day Sabbath was part of the old creation that was fading away.  As the first day of the New Creation, Sunday was also referred to as the “Eighth Day” bc it’s when believers stepped into a new eternal existence of rest and joy with Christ (Confusing I know, but it made sense to the ancients )  

Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, spoke of the Jewish practice of circumcision on the eighth day as prefiguring the Christian observance of the Lord’s Day. “Because the eighth day. . .was to be that on which the Lord should rise again. . .and give us circumcision of the spirit.”



At this time, Sabbath and the Lord’s Day existed side-by-side.  For Jewish Christians,  


Sabbath was still a day of rest/synagogue and The Lord’s day was for meeting with fellow believers for worship and joyously breaking bread (Eucharist) to celebrate Jesus’s resurrection. There was no thought of the Lord’s Day being set aside for Sabbath rest. 



2nd – 4th Century Christians: The Lord’s Day 

Towards the end of the first century, Judaism and Christianity begin to part ways. ** Leaders become more hostile though some relationship continued on a grassroots level.

Ignatius describes Jewish Christians as those who “have come to the possession of a new hope, no longer observing the Sabbath, but living in observance of the Lord’s Day

On a practical level, more and more pagans (gentiles) entered the church who could not keep the Sabbath because they were slaves or had competing responsibilities.  

Some Christians met for a “love feast”/Eucharist meal on Saturday evening after the Jewish Sabbath ended when responsibilities allowed. 

Others met early Sunday morning for a briefer service with Eucharist meal only so believers could attend worship before going to work (this became the norm) 

Also, some Christian leaders began to teach Christians not to keep the Jewish Sabbath out of concern believers might “Judaize” by going back to Mosaic law or because it wasn’t necessary 

Tertullian: “We have nothing to do with sabbaths or the other Jewish Festivals. . . we have our own solemnities, the Lord’s day for instance, and Pentecost.

Origen: refers to the Lord’s Day and says that for the believer “all his days are the Lord’s, and he is always keeping the Lord’s Day.” 

Peter, Bishop of Alexandria: speaking of Sunday worship at the beginning of the 4th c: “We keep the Lord’s Day as a day of joy, because of Him who rose thereon.”  

**NOTE: Some of the fathers developed anti-Semitic views as a result of this parting which may (or may not) have colored their approach to Sabbath. Can’t lump all the fathers together on this.



4th Century: Rest on Sunday

In 313, Constantine issued the Edict of Milan that legalized Christianity and allowed for freedom of worship throughout the empire

In 321, he made it law for the Roman Day of the Sun (Sunday/the Lord’s Day) to become a day of rest for all citizens.  

Constantine’s actions brought about a connection between The Lord’s Day and Sabbath rest that was not present in earlier Christian thought. As we saw above, previously the Lord’s Day was NOT regarded as a day of rest and in fact, could not be for many believers who had no control over their own time. 

Christians had various views:


Eusebius, Bishop of Caesarea, praised the emperor; although he didn’t base the observance of Sunday on the 4th commandment, the bishop drew an analogy between the Lord’s day and the Hebrew Sabbath.  

Athanasius, another bishop who was writing at the same time, declared that sabbath, the end of the old creation, has deceased, and the Lord’s Day, the commencement of the new creation, has set in.

Others adopted a spiritual interpretation of Sabbath, believing the natural pointed ahead to the spiritual (types and shadows).  For example: Bishop Epiphanius contrasted Sabbath of the Law with “The Great Sabbath,” which is Christ Himself.  Asserts the Lord’s Day was established by the apostles.

Bishops Gregory of Nyssa and Ambrose of Milan speak of both the Hebrew Sabbath and the Christian Sunday as allegorical of rest from sin. Gregory calls them “sister days.”



4th, 5th, and 6th Century: Sunday Observance Enforced by Law

After Constantine’s edict, church councils and imperial laws both sought to enforce the proper observance of Sunday. Examples: 

In 363, Council of Laodicea commanded Christians not to observe Saturday, the Jewish Sabbath, but to take Sunday as the day of rest.  Stated that if any “are found ‘Judaizing,’ they shall be shut out from Christ.

Fourth Council of Carthage, 436, threatened to excommunicate anyone who left church during the preaching, prohibited fasting on the Lord’s Day, and discouraged attendance at the Games or the Public Circus on Sunday

Emperors also passed a number of laws forbidding certain activities on Sunday.

Second Council of Macon, 585, banned work and commanded worship on Sunday on the authority of the OT sabbath regulations.

The end result of this evolution is that Sunday became a legalized day of rest; worship on the Lord’s day was ordered by church councils and imperial edicts; and Sunday came to be less sharply distinguished from the Hebrew Sabbath. 

Practices still not uniform among Christians: “assemblies not held in all churches on the same time or manner.”

Historian Sozoman: “The people of Constantinople, and almost everywhere, assemble together on the Sabbath, as well as on the first day of the week, which custom is never observed at Rome or at Alexandria (meaning they stopped meeting on Sabbath).” 

7th – 16th Centuries: Sunday Practices Based on OT Sabbath Commands  

As Christianity became more and more legalistic, it became quite natural to use OT Sabbath laws to justify enforcing rules about Sunday.

By 8


th c. previous concerns about “sabbatarianism” fell by the wayside and the observance of Lord’s Day was based on the 4th Commandment. 

In 12th C. Peter Alphonsus was the first to use the term, “Christian Sabbath” of the Lord’s day. (Hessey, Sunday, p. 90) 

Thomas Aquinas in 13th c. was the first to distinguish between moral and ceremonial law re: the observance of Sunday, (a distinction that is still used today re: what parts of the Mosaic law apply/don’t apply to Christians) 

He separated the moral element in the 4th commandment re: the obligation to worship God from the ceremonial element of doing it on the 7th day. (Allowing for worship to happen on a different day)

Said that Sunday honors 4th commandment for keeping Sabbath not because of a legal precept, but because the Church made the decision, and it was a Christian custom.

By the later medieval period, Sunday became known as the Christian Sabbath; its observance was grounded on the 4th commandment or the canons of the church; and was enforced by severe ecclesiastical and secular restrictions, similar to those imposed on the observance of the Jewish sabbath. 



16th – 17th c. The Reformation – Mixed Views

Luther: believers in Christ were not subject to Jewish laws or ceremonies 

Christians are holy at all times so no need of festivals such as Sunday or the Sabbath; free to meet anytime.

Believed working classes needed a weekly day of rest but insisted that “no day is better or more excellent than another.” 

Spoke against basing Sunday rest on a Jewish foundation

Zwingli: shared Luther’s view that worship of God should not be tied down to any one day.

Calvin: regarded the Hebrew Sabbath as a type of the entire rest and peace granted to Christians under the gospel; part of the “shadow of things to come” (Col 2:16-17) fulfilled in Christ, who is the body, the whole essence of truth. Saw the value of setting one day apart for rest but treated observance of Sunday as a matter of expediency.

John Knox: agreed substantially with Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, but called for greater strictness in keeping Sunday as a day of worship. 

All Reformers above insisted Sunday observance should not be based on the OT sabbath commandment or in any way connected with the Hebrew Sabbath.

Post-Reformation Creedal Statements showed what groups and not just individuals believed; some differences (See Confession of Augsburg, second Helvetic Confession, Westminster Confession) 

All creeds agreed that since the apostles, the Lord’s Day was the appointed time 


for Christian worship; some included rest in observing the day. 

The Westminster Confession says, “from the beginning of the world to the Resurrection of Christ,” Sabbath, the last day of the week, was to be kept Holy unto God” . . . and from “the Resurrection of Christ to the end of the world,” the first day of the week, which in Scripture is called the Lord’s day, is to be the Christian Sabbath.” 

Two Kinds of Sabbatarianism Emerged 

Puritans, Sunday Sabbath.  The Westminster Confession was drafted by the English Puritans as a protest against practices of Church of England, which they regarded as contrary to Scripture. 

Since the Westminster Divines did not find any command in the NT to observe the Lord’s day, they boldly identified it with the sabbath of the 4th commandment and enforced its observance with all the rigor of the ancient Hebrew Sabbath. 

Made laws against “idleness or doing that which is in itself is sinful, or by unnecessary thoughts, words, or works about worldly employments and recreations.” 

Little was said about the first day of the week as the day of Christ’s resurrection, except to claim that by rising on that day Christ had put an end to the old 7th day Sabbath and established a first day Sabbath.

Even less said about the first day of the week being the first day of creation and the resurrection being the first day of the new creation, or about Sunday as the eighth day of the week, which was an announcement and a forestate of the final day.

Sunday had become a day of obligation and self-discipline, to be devoted to churchgoing, prayer, and works of charity 

Communion, which had so long been the center of Sunday worship, was an infrequent celebration, no longer focusing on the joy of the Lord’s resurrection, “but rather on the sorrow of one’s sinfulness and the cross to which it led.” (Gonzalez, Brief History, p. 132)

Puritan teachings affected other countries besides England; accepted by Church and parliament of Scotland, introduced into Holland; Puritans also brought the concept of Christian Sabbath to America, where it became the prevailing view for centuries. 

Seventh-Day Sabbatarianism.  Not all agreed there was biblical support for turning Sunday into a “Christian Sabbath” 

Many adherents believed Sunday/Lord’s Day worship was invented by Constantine or the popes (which, as we have seen, was not the case)

Taught Sabbath should be restored to the 7


th day of the week, as the 4th commandment ordered, that it was woven into the fabric of creation in Genesis; some also advocated returning to OT dietary laws.

In 1661, these ideas merged with growing Baptist movement, resulting in the birth of the Seventh-Day Baptists.  Movement has taken many forms. Today, Seventh-day Adventist Church has 20 million members worldwide.



1648 to Present, Modern Period

Sunday in Europe, England, and Scotland—ask me if you want more info.

Sunday in the US: The Puritans who came to the America established “Christian Sabbath” as an integral part of their social and religious life.

To ensure observance, church/civic government enacted what came to be known as “Blue Laws,” which were even stricter than those formulated by the ancient Jews 

As in England, commerce, trade and nonessential work or travel were forbidden, as were plays, festivities, and other such activities. 

Infractions were met with severe punishment. 

Influence of Puritanism on American religious life cannot be overemphasized; the Christian Sabbath of the Puritans “worked itself into the hearts and minds of the American people and became a standard of the ideal Sunday of America for many generations.”

In the 19th c. a backlash began against the strict Sunday Sabbath laws.

A 1917 report noted that while Sunday was still being observed as a day of rest, it’s observance as a day of worship was declining.

Strict laws were challenged in court and observance of the day has continued to decline, become laxer and more secularized, yet in spite of this,

“well into the twenty-first century Sabbath laws still held much appeal for vast numbers of conservative Christians who were convinced that, as in the times of Puritan power, civil government had the obligation to make certain that the law of God was obeyed not only by faithful believers but also by society at large—what is often called the “third use of the law.”  (NOTE: this dynamic is still at play in today’s political divides)

In recent history, a quiet liturgical renewal has been underway as Christians have been looking anew at their worship practices. 

Has led to “the rediscovery of the ancient meanings of Sunday, and therefore to granting more significance to Sunday, no longer as a sort of Christian Sabbath, but rather as the day of the resurrection of Christ, marking the beginning of a new creation and the promise of a final consummation.” 

“This has made Sunday worship more celebratory” for many. 


NOTE: The Eastern Orthodox branch of the church has long held the “Eighth Day” view. This is how they describe it:  

The Sabbath day is the seventh day, it is the day of rest in this world, the final day of the week. The next day, Sunday, is symbolic of the first day of creation . . . The first day is also the eighth day, the day beyond the confines of this world, the day which stands for the life of the world to come, the day of the eternal rest of the Kingdom of God.

The number eight has symbolical significance in both Jewish and Christian spiritual tradition in that it signifies more than completion and fullness. Eight signifies the Kingdom of God and the life of the world to come, seven being the number of earthly time.

For Orthodox Christians, Sunday is the day of Christ's resurrection from the dead, the day of God's judgment and victory predicted by the prophets. Sunday inaugurates the presence and the power of the "kingdom to come", already within the life of this present world. It is a weekly celebration of Pascha (Easter) 



4 Views of Sabbath from Perspectives on the Sabbath, ed. Christopher John Donato



The “Seventh Day Sabbath” (The 10 commandments are still in effect; even if Christ fulfilled them, it doesn’t negate them, including the 4th commandment. NOTE:  John Mark Comer practices a version of this)



The “Christian Sabbath” (our inheritance from Medieval times/the Puritans; see above)



Luther’s Radical Reading of the Sabbath Commandment (believes Christ is the end of the law, period, therefore, 10 commandments not given to Christians.  This gives believers the liberty to look at the decalogue in light of created order/natural law written in the heart of all people instead of how they specifically applied to Israelites. Re: 4th commanded, 7th day Sabbath was a day for the Jews to remember the Exodus, rest)



The Sabbath is Fulfilled in Christ (Jesus is our 24/7/365 sabbath rest; see Hebrews 4)


It’s not possible to look at the entire scriptural rationale for each of these views here, but you can pretty much see the reasoning as you go through the historical outline. For those who want to dig deeper, detailed biblical exegesis for each view is presented in the book. 







Paul’s Perspective

As we consider this evolution of Sabbath/Sunday, Paul’s statement in Colossians 2:16-17* comes to mind. First, he describes what Jesus did on the cross to accomplish our freedom and union with him then says:  


“Therefore, let no one pass judgment on you in questions of food and drink, or with 


regard to a festival or a new moon or a Sabbath. These are a shadow of the things to come, but the substance belongs to Christ.”


In Romans 14:5, Paul says: 


“One person esteems one day as better than another, while another esteems all days alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind.”


*NOTE: Sabbatarians say Paul is coming against “human commands and teachings” (Col. 2:22) not 7th day worship in this text (very important to read the entire context of Colossians when considering this). Re: Romans 14:5, Sabbatarians contend Paul is referring to “disputable matters” here, not Sabbath, “which God embedded in the 10 commandments.” (4 Perspectives, p. 31)



Questions

What are your thoughts after going through this outline? 

Did any particular view resonate with you? Why? 

How does this affect your view of community worship? Rest/a day of rest? 

Do we each decide individually or is this something we do together as a community? Or both? 

Why is it important for us to meet together? (See Hebrews 10:24-25)

How are we to regard those who hold different opinions?
