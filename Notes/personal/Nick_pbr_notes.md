Good job working through the nervousness when you started. This is something you care about and think can help the company, and it`s important to you. But the practice
you have had soon took over, and you were able to overcome the initial jitters.

It`s okay to have forgotten the display thing; we are all in a strange place with the whole pandemic thing, and keeping it light might help dispel a little bit of awkwardness
and/or empathy the participants may feel. "Gah, I am missing meeting in person!" "How many IT guys does it take to run a Google Meet?" kind of stuff. I am self-depracating 
by nature, and I tend to fall back on that. It works for me, but it isn`t for everyone. Also, I might have to change that in order to advance further. 

When Michael interjected about the risk management thing, I think you handled that well. In my experience, he has good stuff to contribute and has good thoughts. I was 
hoping someone else would input their two cents, but dang it they stayed muted. 

Good explanation of optimizing changes quickly.

Tim was eating some food when you asked him haha. But the discussion with the cultural capabilities was really successful. It looks like people were interested and it hit 
a chord with basically all of them. 

David got all in a weird place with the business solution PBR platform. Looks like that caused a lot of feedback, and might have touched a nerve. This is, in my opinion,
a symptom of the business being in a master-slave relationship. Tech-to-business translators was an interesting thing. 

The T Developer it seems you`re wanting more balance with developers. Looks like it resonated as well, but the issue is the idea of a restructure. Perhaps there could be 
an idea for a testing area? maybe focus on a part of the business (web app or service for one aspect of the business), and see what can be done?
