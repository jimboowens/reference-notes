what is a container? a container is an image that is running. Pipelines promote images from one place to another. 

Images live in a registry, and OCP can deploy from other registries. Images then get tagged, and OCP can rollout 
new updates. 

Pods are units of deployment and management that are wrapped around a container. A daemonset ensures that all
(or some) nodes run a copy of a pot. 

routes make services accessible to clients outside the env via real-world urls
